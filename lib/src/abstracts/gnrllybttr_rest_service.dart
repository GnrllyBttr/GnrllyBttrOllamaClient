/// A contract for making HTTP requests in a Dart/Flutter application.

/// This abstract class provides a consistent interface for performing common
/// HTTP operations such as `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, and streaming data.
/// It is designed to be flexible, extensible, and easy to use, while abstracting
/// away the complexities of HTTP communication.
///
/// Implementations of this class should handle the underlying HTTP client logic,
/// such as setting headers, managing timeouts, and handling errors.
